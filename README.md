# tiny-task
A very simple issue tracking system.  Used in house by sambwa.com.  Excellent for remote teams with less than a half dozen users.  Simply send an email message to a designated email address and the subject line becomes the task, the sender the task owner and the task can be administered from a web interface for the entire team to see.  See a live <a href="http://bugs.sambwa.com/">demo here</a>.
